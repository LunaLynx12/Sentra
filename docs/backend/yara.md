# Understanding YARA Rules

## What is YARA?
YARA is a tool used for identifying and classifying malware based on patterns. It helps security researchers and analysts detect threats by writing rules that describe malware characteristics.

## Structure of a YARA Rule
Each YARA rule consists of three main sections:

1. *Meta Section* (Optional)  
   - Contains metadata about the rule, such as author, description, and date.

   ```yara
   rule ExampleRule {
       meta:
           author = "Yara_author"
           description = "Detects a specific malware signature"

    ```
2. *Strings Section*
    - Contains plaintext strings, hexadeciaml values and regular expressions.

    ```yara
    strings:
    $a = "malicious.exe"
    $b = "trojan"
    $c = "ransomware"
    ```
3. *Condition Section*
    - The condition section defines the logic for when the rule should match a file. It uses the identifiers defined in the strings section.

    ```yara 
    condition:
    $a or $b or $c
    ```

    ```yara

    rule MalwareDetection {
        meta:
            description = "Detects common malware-related strings"
            author = "Alina"
            date = "2025-05-17"
        strings:
            $a = "malicious.exe"
            $b = "trojan"
            $c = "ransomware"
        condition:
            $a or $b or $c
    }
    ```
